Setting up an alternate GEE Portal
1. Create and checkout a new git branch for the code (do NOT make these changes on master!)
2. Pick the directory and port for the new server
3. Set the port and the script_dir in gee-master/config.json.  The script_dir is
   where the .plcsh files live, which doesn't necessarily change.  Configuration is
   now independent of where the plcsh scripts live
4. Pick the directory where the configuration for the .plcsh files will live.
   Then set GEE_CONFIG_FILE in both start-gee-master.sh and run-gee-server.sh
   to this variable
5. Edit igplc-scripts/config.py to reflect how how want the InstaGENI PLC scripts
   configured
6. Edit remote_dir in gee-master/fabfile.py to be where you want the server to live
7. Edit remote_dir in igplc-scripts/fabfile.py to be where you want the scripts to live
(as mentioned above, in general this won't change).  Edit remote_config_file_dir
in igplc-scripts/fabfile.py to be where you want the configuration file to live
(this WILL change: GEE_CONFIG_FILE == <remote_config_file_dir>/config.ph)
